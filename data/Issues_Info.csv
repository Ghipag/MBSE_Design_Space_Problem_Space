Parameter_variation_language,Cant describe how a designs parameters change between different design options,UML;SysML_V1;Capella_Language;OPM_Language;SDL;Valispace_Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,5,SysML- new stereotypes or product line engineering approach
Topology_variation_language,Cant describe how a designs topology change between different design options,UML;SysML_V1;Capella_Language;OPM_Language;SDL;Valispace_Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,4,"SysML- new stereotypes, needs tools support to generating new relationships"
Multiplicity_variation_language,Cant describe how a design elements multiplicity changes between different design options,UML;SysML_V1;Capella_Language;OPM_Language;SDL;Valispace_Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,3,"SysML- can define multiplicity but not change this, however the definition can be flexible, e.g. 2* means at least two of something, this could be leveraged as a multiplicity constraint"
Element_variation_language,Cant describe how a design elements type changes between different design options,UML;SysML_V1;Capella_Language;OPM_Language;SDL;Valispace_Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,5,"SysML- can define type but need tool support to change this automatically, also need new stereotypes or external ontology to describe the set of possible types"
