Name,Summary,Affected_Aspects,Severity,Workaround
Parameter variation language,Cant describe how a designs parameters change between different design options,UML;SysML V1;Capella Language;OPM Language;SDL;Valispace Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,5,SysML- new stereotypes or product line engineering approach
Topology variation language,Cant describe how a designs topology change between different design options,UML;SysML V1;Capella Language;OPM Language;SDL;Valispace Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,4,"SysML- new stereotypes, needs tools support to generating new relationships"
Multiplicity variation language,Cant describe how a design elements multiplicity changes between different design options,UML;SysML V1;Capella Language;OPM Language;SDL;Valispace Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,3,"SysML- can define multiplicity but not change this, however the definition can be flexible, e.g. 2* means at least two of something, this could be leveraged as a multiplicity constraint"
Element variation language,Cant describe how a design elements type changes between different design options,UML;SysML V1;Capella Language;OPM Language;SDL;Valispace Language;RML;AADL;SLIM,5,"SysML- can define type but need tool support to change this automatically, also need new stereotypes or external ontology to describe the set of possible types"
Tool based variation,Cant switch between different design options,Cameo;Capella;Papyrus;Valispace;Rapsody;Enterprise Architect;OPMCloud;GENSYS;RePoSyD Tool;TASTE;COMPASS 3.0,4,SysML/ cameo simulation tool kit- could use instance specifications for parameter level variability
Exploration  stage in methodology,No well defined stage at which exploration of design alternatives (in physical architecture) should take place,ARCADIA;OOSEM;RePoSyD;STRATA;OPM;Valispace Method;MOFLT;COMPASS;SEAM;TASTE Method,3,Define new stage between logical/ functional architecture definition and physical architecture definition for exploration
Identification of what aspects to vary and at what level,No well defined method for selecting aspects of a design to vary (apart from starting from nothing),ARCADIA;OOSEM;RePoSyD;STRATA;OPM;Valispace Method;MOFLT;COMPASS;SEAM;TASTE Method,3,Rule set for what elements can vary and how
Simulation Time,It is expensive to do full system simulations for many design alternatives,Cameo;Capella;Papyrus;Valispace;Rapsody;Enterprise Architect;OPMCloud;GENSYS;RePoSyD Tool;TASTE;COMPASS 3.0,4,"Reduce system model for simulation, e.g. surrogate model, multiscale model etc."
